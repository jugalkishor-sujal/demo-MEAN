Write an application that tracks jogging times of users

  - User must be able to create an account and log in

  - When logged in, user can see, edit and delete his times he entered

  - Each time entry when entered has a date, distance, and time

  - When displayed, each time entry has an average speed

  - Filter by dates from-to

  - Report on average speed & distance per week

  - REST API – for all user actions 

  - In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly.

  - All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable.
 
  - Bonus: unit tests!

  - You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible.
